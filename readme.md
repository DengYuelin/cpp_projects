# C++ Projects

Welcome to my personal C++ project repository. This space is dedicated to small, focused projects that help sharpen my skills in C++ programming.

## Environment:

Tested on WSL - Ubuntu 24.04

-   Build system: cmake version 3.28.3
-   Compiler: g++ (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0

## Directory Structure

cpp_projects/
├── puzzles/ # Algorithm practice and classic problems
├── refresher/ # Library usage and feature demos
└── libs/ # Shared utility headers/functions

## Goals

-   Practice clean, modern C++ design
-   Explore STL and third-party libraries through practical examples
-   Improve algorithmic problem-solving through implementation
-   Create reusable code snippets and templates for future reference
